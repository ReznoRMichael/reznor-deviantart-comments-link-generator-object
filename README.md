# Reznor deviantart comment links generator v1.0
> Simple program that I've written for personal needs in Object C++ (using Classes and member functions)

## General info
Program that I've written specifically for myself for generating deviantart comments links and saving them into text file.
It generates links in the following template:
`https://comments.deviantart.com/[leading_number]/[link_number]/`
It asks the user for the `[leading_number]`, then for the starting and ending link number. Then it calculates how many links it will generate, starts the timer, and begins saving all the links into `da_comments_links.txt` file. After the saving is completed, it stops the timer, and calculates the time it took to generate and save the file. Then the user is presented with a thank you screen with the time it took and waiting for input to end the program.
