# Reznor deviantart comment links generator v1.0
> Simple program in Object C++ (using Classes and member functions)

## General info
Program that I've first written in procedural C++, and then rewritten using Classes and a Timer specifically for myself for generating deviantart comments links and saving them into text file.
It generates links in the following template:
`https://comments.deviantart.com/[leading_number]/[link_number]/`
It asks the user for the `[leading_number]`, then for the starting and ending link number. Then it calculates how many links it will generate, starts the timer, and begins saving all the links into `da_comments_links.txt` file. After the saving is completed, it stops the timer, and calculates the time it took to generate and save the file. Then the user is presented with a thank you screen with the time it took and waiting for input to end the program.

## Technologies
* Object C++
* CodeBlocks (IDE)
* GNU GCC Compiler (minGW)

## Inspiration
Creating this program in the first place wouldn't be possible without one very special and unique person who inspired it. A certain Angel, thanks to whom I believed in myself to go back into programming and who was a reason why I've written this program in the first place. All that I'm doing I'm dedicating to you.
